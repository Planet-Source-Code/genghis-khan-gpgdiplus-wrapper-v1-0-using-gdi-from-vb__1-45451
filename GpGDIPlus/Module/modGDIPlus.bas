' Translated by Avery P. - 7/29/2002
' NOTES:
'   - All GDI+ Strings expect and return ONLY Unicode - you'll need to use StrConv when using them or convert the APIs to use StrPtr.
'     As always, there are a few exceptions to a rule, and ImageTitles are one string that uses only ANSI strings.
'   - Functions with an I (i) at the end are non-floating point declarations.
'   - If a function without the I (i) at the end doesn't work, try the one with (if any).
'     If neither version worked, then you did something wrong, or the API *may* be misdeclared.
'   - The word (ALL) next to an API set mean all of the functions are declared. (ALL GDI+ functions are now declared 8/12/2002)
'   - Search for "TODO:" (no quotes) to see what still needs done within the file. If there is no TODO, there is nothing to do!
'   - If you want to get all of the encoder or decoder file extensions, MIME type, or other values, try to use the Get__Clsid functions as a base.
'   - If you don't like the idea of converting strings to and from Unicode, change all As String occurances in the API declarations
'     to As Long, and pass the StrPtr() result there instead. I opted to use the As String for clarity, especially since the GDI+ docs are
'     geared toward how to use the C++ classes.
'   - I may have misdeclared the IStream functions as I'm not too familiar with them. Do a "TODO:" or "IStream" search (no quotes) to see the
'     IStream functions. All parameters except one where declared as 'IStream* stream' in C++. The exception has a comment above it. The possible
'     problem is that the IStream parameters should be passed ByRef instead of ByVal. If they are wrong, please tell me!
'   - APIs are in ordered groups, just like the C++ header, but the groups themselves are not in the same order as in the C++ headers.
'
' WARNINGS:
'   - Some of the structs may not work, though I didn't test them all fully.
'   - If a function causes a GPF or performs unexpectedly, make sure you are passing correct arguments.
'     It also couldn't hurt to double-check the declarations as there is a chance they could be a bit off and looking in the MSDN can't hurt either.
'   - Some APIs that have a ByRef parameter may expect an array; check the MSDN to find out if unsure.
'
'-----------------------------------------------
' 2/6/2003
' - I suppose I should put change notifications here in case you missed them on PSC.
' - Altered the ColorPalette to have 256 color palette entries regardless and the flags member is mapped to the PaletteFlags enum.
' - ImageCodecInfo now has the flags member mapped to the ImageCodecFlags enum.
' - GdipBitmapLockBits flags parameter changed to the ImageLockMode enum instead of a Long.
' - Altered the LOGFONTW lfFaceName member to be a String, which is twice as long as the ANSI to adjust for unicode.
'   You'll want to use a StrConv on it to get the ANSI text. Also introduced a new constant to ease maintainance: LF_FACESIZEW
